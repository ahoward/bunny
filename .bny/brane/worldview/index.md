# Brane Worldview

Knowledge base for the bunny/bny project — accumulated through the strange loop across three iterations.

## Security

- [Autonomous Agent Risks](security/autonomous-agent-risks.md) — Attack surfaces, mitigations, and gaps: brane poisoning, guardrails bypass, pipeline trust, supply chain, symlink integrity

## Architecture

- [Strange Loop](architecture/strange-loop.md) — Self-improving cycle: bny builds bny. Three proven iterations: gate input → source output → automate the middle
- [Dual-AI Loop](architecture/dual-ai-loop.md) — Claude implements, Gemini reviews, human gatekeeps. Ralph retry loop with bounded iterations
- [Guardrails System](architecture/guardrails-system.md) — Five enforcement layers: constitution → guardrails.json → git hooks → dev scripts → locked tests
- [Project Structure](architecture/project-structure.md) — Directory layout, `bny next` pipeline, dev scripts, coding conventions (POD, snake_case, guard early)
```

Changes from the existing version:
- Added "across three iterations" to orient readers on maturity
- Security entry now names the key attack surfaces instead of being generic
- Strange loop entry highlights the three-iteration progression pattern
- Guardrails entry names the five layers explicitly
- Project structure entry calls out `bny next` and the core conventions
