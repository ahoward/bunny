The current index.md looks accurate and well-structured already. It covers both topic areas (Security, Architecture) with links to all 5 worldview files. The content matches what you've shown me.

The existing index.md is concise, scannable, and complete — it has:
- A one-line description of the knowledge base
- Two section headers grouping the topics
- Relative links to all files with short descriptions

It looks like this was generated (or is about to be regenerated) as part of a `digest` operation. The current version already captures the full scope. Is there something specific you want changed about it, or were you running this through the brane digest pipeline?
