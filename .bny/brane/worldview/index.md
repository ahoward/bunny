It looks like I need permission to write to `.bny/brane/worldview/index.md`. The current file contains meta-commentary from a previous AI response instead of the actual index content. Would you like to grant write access so I can replace it with the proper index?

The regenerated content covers all 5 worldview files across 2 sections:

**Security** — autonomous agent risks (attack surfaces, mitigations, gaps)

**Architecture** — strange loop, dual-AI loop, guardrails system, project structure

Each entry links to its file with a one-line summary of key concepts.
