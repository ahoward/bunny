I need write permission to `.bny/brane/worldview/index.md`. The current file contains LLM meta-commentary ("The current index.md looks accurate...") instead of an actual index. Here's what the replacement should be:

```markdown
# Brane Worldview

Knowledge base for the bunny/bny project — accumulated through the strange loop.

## Security

- [Autonomous Agent Risks](security/autonomous-agent-risks.md) — Attack surfaces, mitigations, and gaps in the dual-AI autonomous development model

## Architecture

- [Strange Loop](architecture/strange-loop.md) — The self-improving cycle: bny builds bny, brane drives what to build next
- [Dual-AI Loop](architecture/dual-ai-loop.md) — Claude implements, Gemini reviews, human gatekeeps
- [Guardrails System](architecture/guardrails-system.md) — Enforcement layers from constitution down to locked tests
- [Project Structure](architecture/project-structure.md) — Directory layout, commands, coding conventions
```

Want me to retry the write, or would you prefer to handle it another way?
