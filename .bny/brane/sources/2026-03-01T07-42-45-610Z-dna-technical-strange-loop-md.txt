# The Strange Loop

bny builds bny. The system improves its own tooling through the same process it uses to build anything else.

## Why It Works

The brane is project memory that compounds. Every iteration deposits knowledge — what was built, what broke, what the human thought about it, what the research said. The next iteration starts from a richer worldview. Specs get sharper because they're informed by everything that came before.

Traditional dev cycles lose context between iterations. Decisions evaporate. Rationale disappears into slack threads. The brane doesn't forget. You can ask it *why* something is the way it is, and it knows, because someone ate the reasoning.

## The Cycle

```
research / eat
     ↓
ask → what should we build?
     ↓
specify → plan → implement → review  (dark factory)
     ↓
human reviews
     ↓
eat feedback
     ↓
digest (if lenses changed)
     ↓
repeat
```

Each pass is waterfall-shaped. The iterations are tight. The brane bridges them.

## Why It's Safe

A self-improving system sounds dangerous. It is — without constraints. bny has five:

1. **Blast radius.** Each iteration can only change N files, M lines. No single PR rewrites the system.
2. **Antagonist review.** Gemini reviews every change Claude makes. Two AIs with different roles catch more than one.
3. **Human checkpoint.** Every PR gets human review. The human writes the feedback that feeds the next iteration.
4. **Locked tests.** After Gemini review, tests cannot change without human approval. The factory can't weaken its own acceptance criteria.
5. **Protected files.** The constitution, guardrails, and decision log are off-limits to autonomous agents.

The loop is powerful *because* it's bounded. An unconstrained self-improving system is a runaway train. A constrained one is a flywheel.

## POVs As Iteration Lenses

Early iterations run with broad lenses: `all`, `product`. As the project matures, you add `security`, `perf`, `ops`. Running `digest` reprocesses every stashed source through the new lenses. The worldview shifts. The next roadmap reflects concerns you weren't tracking before.

This is how priorities evolve without losing history. The raw sources don't change. The perspective does.

## Feedback As First-Class Knowledge

Human feedback isn't a jira comment. It's a markdown file that gets eaten into the brane. "The auth flow is too complex" becomes a concept in the worldview. It influences every future spec, every future review, every future `ask`.

This means the human's taste and judgment accumulate in the system over time. The factory doesn't just get smarter about the code — it gets smarter about what the human wants.

## The Recursive Quality

bny improving bny is not a gimmick. It's the hardest test case. If the system can safely modify its own tooling — the dispatcher, the brane, the guardrails enforcement, the prompt engineering — through the constrained loop, it can build anything.

If it can't, that's valuable too. The failure modes of self-improvement are the most informative failures possible.
