# Roadmap

## Next

- [x] Core mood API — POST /moods to record a mood entry (person, score 1-5, optional note), GET /moods/:person for history
- [x] Team trends — GET /trends/person/:name and GET /trends/team for 30-day rolling averages with daily breakdown
- [x] Input validation and error handling — validate score range, require person field, structured error responses

## Done
